# moored_data_buoy_analysis
moored data buoy using advanced machine learning methods
I completed my MTech thesis in Ocean Technology through the National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT), Chennai, under the Ministry of Earth Sciences. The project focused on analyzing 10 years of hourly oceanographic data from moored buoys, covering parameters like temperature, pressure, wave height, and current speed.

The data required extensive filtering due to sensor failures, missing values, and extreme weather outliers. Using SQL databases, I organized and managed the datasets, and created Power BI dashboards for data visualization. For predictions, I utilized Python programming and applied Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), improving forecast accuracy by 25% and enhancing predictions for environmental indicators like tsunami detection and sea level changes. Feature selection further optimized model performance, achieving 95% prediction accuracy and improving traditional methods by 30%.

This project combined data analysis, visualization, and machine learning, sharpening my skills in precision, adaptability, and leveraging advanced technologies for real-world challenges.
